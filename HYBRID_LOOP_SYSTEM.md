# ToneDAW - Hybrid Loop System Documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Implementation: Hybrid Approach

After evaluating both custom loop expansion and Tone.js native loops, we've implemented a **hybrid system** that combines the best of both approaches.

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

### **Playback Audio: Tone.js Native Loops**
- Uses `Part.loop = true` with `Part.loopStart` and `Part.loopEnd`
- Leverages Tone.js's built-in timing precision
- Minimal custom code, maximum reliability
- Standard DAW behavior that musicians expect

```javascript
// In setupAudio()
if (seq.loop && seq.loop !== false) {
    part.loop = true;
    part.loopStart = 0;
    
    if (typeof seq.loop === 'string') {
        part.loopEnd = seq.loop; // e.g., "0:4", "1:0", "2:0"
    } else if (seq.loop === true) {
        // Calculate end of original sequence
        const lastNoteTime = Math.max(...seq.notes.map(n => 
            Tone.Time(n.time).toSeconds() + Tone.Time(n.duration).toSeconds()
        ));
        part.loopEnd = Tone.Time(lastNoteTime).toBarsBeatsSixteenths();
    }
}
```

### **Visual Display: Custom Loop Expansion**
- Still uses `expandNotesWithLoop()` for visual representation
- Shows all loop repetitions as note blocks with dashed borders
- Provides clear visual feedback of loop behavior
- Maintains debugging capabilities

```javascript
// In drawNotes()
const expandedNotes = this.expandNotesWithLoop(track.seq);
expandedNotes.forEach(note => {
    // Create visual note blocks
    if (note.isLooped) {
        noteElement.classList.add('looped-note');
        noteElement.title += ' (Looped)';
    }
});
```

### **Export Behavior: Mixed Approach**
- **MIDI Export**: Uses expanded notes (includes all loop repetitions)
- **WAV Export**: Uses Tone.js native loops (more efficient, same audio result)

## âœ… Benefits of Hybrid System

### **1. Reliable Timing**
- Tone.js handles all audio timing internally
- No custom timing calculations prone to drift
- Consistent with professional audio software

### **2. Visual Clarity**
- Users see exactly what will happen
- Loop repetitions are clearly indicated
- Debugging information available

### **3. Simplified Code**
- Less custom loop logic in audio path
- Leverages well-tested Tone.js functionality
- Easier to maintain and debug

### **4. Performance**
- Tone.js optimized timing algorithms
- No need to create hundreds of note objects for long projects
- Better memory usage for complex arrangements

### **5. Standard Behavior**
- Follows DAW conventions musicians expect
- Compatible with Tone.js ecosystem
- Future-proof as Tone.js evolves

## ðŸŽ¹ Loop Configuration Examples

### Quick Loops (Percussion)
```javascript
{
    label: "Hi-Hat",
    loop: "0:2", // Every 2 beats
    notes: [
        { note: 'C#2', time: 0, duration: '16n' },
        { note: 'C#2', time: '0:1', duration: '16n' }
    ]
}
```

### Standard Loops (Bass/Melody)
```javascript
{
    label: "Bass Line",
    loop: "1:0", // Every measure
    notes: [
        { note: 'C3', time: 0, duration: '4n' },
        { note: 'F3', time: '0:2', duration: '4n' }
    ]
}
```

### Long Form Loops (Chord Progressions)
```javascript
{
    label: "Chord Changes",
    loop: "4:0", // Every 4 measures
    notes: [
        { note: ['C4','E4','G4'], time: 0, duration: '1n' },
        { note: ['F4','A4','C5'], time: '1:0', duration: '1n' },
        // ... more chords
    ]
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### **Audio Engine**
- Original `seq.notes` passed to `Tone.Part`
- `Part.loop`, `Part.loopStart`, `Part.loopEnd` configured
- Tone.js handles all timing internally

### **Visual Engine**
- `expandNotesWithLoop()` generates display notes
- Visual notes marked with `isLooped: true`
- CSS styling shows dashed borders for loops

### **Export Engine**
- **MIDI**: Uses `expandNotesWithLoop()` for complete note list
- **WAV**: Uses native `Part.loop` for audio generation

## ðŸš€ Migration Benefits

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

The hybrid approach successfully combines Tone.js's reliable audio timing with our custom visual system. This provides:

- **Professional audio timing** via Tone.js native loops
- **Clear visual feedback** via custom loop expansion
- **Complete export functionality** with both approaches
- **Maintainable codebase** with clear separation of concerns

This implementation gives users the precision they need for music production while maintaining the visual clarity that makes the DAW easy to use and debug.

## âœ… Final Status: PRODUCTION READY

After comprehensive evaluation and testing, this hybrid loop system is **approved as the final implementation**. It provides:

- **Superior audio quality** compared to pure custom systems
- **Complete visual feedback** compared to pure Tone.js systems
