# ToneDAW - Fixed Issues Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. JavaScript Syntax Errors - FIXED
- **Issue**: "redeclaration of const Midi" error
- **Fix**: Removed the problematic line `const Midi = window.Midi;` from ToneDAW.js
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

- **Issue**: "missing { before function body" syntax error in togglePlay method
- **Fix**: Properly wrapped animation logic in a function structure
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

### 2. Chord Playback Issues - FIXED
- **Issue**: Chords (note arrays like ["C4","E4","G4"]) not playing correctly
- **Fix**: Implemented proper chord detection in setupAudio() method:
  ```javascript
  const hasChord = seq.notes.some(n => Array.isArray(n.note));
  ```
- **Implementation**: When chords are detected, uses `Tone.PolySynth` instead of `MonoSynth`
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved for both live playback and WAV export

### 3. Progress Line Timing - FIXED
- **Issue**: Progress line not matching note block positions during playback
- **Fix**: Changed from percentage-based to pixel-based positioning:
  ```javascript
  this.progressLine.style.left = (this.transport.seconds * this.pixelsPerSecond) + 'px';
  ```
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved - Progress line now moves in sync with note positions

### 4. Animation System - IMPROVED
- **Issue**: Multiple animation loops could conflict
- **Fix**: Added proper animation frame management:
  - Added `this.animationId` to track animation frame
  - Proper cleanup with `cancelAnimationFrame()` when stopping
  - Single animation loop called from `togglePlay()`
- **Status**: âœ… Enhanced and optimized

### 5. WAV Export Functionality - FIXED
- **Issue**: WAV export not handling chords properly
- **Fix**: Applied the same chord detection logic to `exportWAV()` method
- **Implementation**: Uses PolySynth for tracks with chords during offline rendering
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved - WAV export now works correctly with chords

### 6. Note Visualization - ENHANCED
- **Issue**: Limited debugging information for note timing
- **Fix**: Enhanced note tooltip to show timing information:
  ```javascript
  noteElement.title = `${noteText} at ${note.time} for ${note.duration}`;
  ```
- **Status**: âœ… Improved debugging capability

## ðŸŽ¯ TIMING VERIFICATION

### Expected Note Positions (pixelsPerSecond = 60, BPM = 120):

**Lead Melody Track:**
- C4 at time 0 â†’ 0 pixels from left
- E4 at time "0:1" (0.5s) â†’ 30 pixels from left  
- G4 at time "0:2" (1.0s) â†’ 60 pixels from left
- [C4,E4,G4] chord at time "0:3" (1.5s) â†’ 90 pixels from left

**Bass Line Track:**
- C3 at time 0 â†’ 0 pixels from left
- F3 at time "0:2" (1.0s) â†’ 60 pixels from left
- G3 at time "1:0" (2.0s) â†’ 120 pixels from left
- C3 at time "1:2" (3.0s) â†’ 180 pixels from left

## ðŸ§ª TEST PROCEDURES

### 1. Visual Timing Test
1. Open the application
2. Click play and observe the red progress line
3. Verify that the progress line passes over each note block precisely when the note sounds
4. Test with different BPM values to ensure timing scales correctly

### 2. Chord Playback Test
1. Look for the chord note block labeled "C4,E4,G4" in the Lead Melody track
2. Play the sequence and verify you hear all three notes simultaneously
3. Test different synth types with chords

### 3. WAV Export Test
1. Click the "WAV" export button
2. Verify that the download completes without errors
3. Play the exported WAV file and confirm chords are properly rendered

### 4. Synth Selection Test
1. Change synth types for different tracks
2. Verify that tracks with chords automatically use PolySynth when needed
3. Test both mono and poly synth behaviors
